## Unicontsoft Fiscal Printers Component

UcsFP is a COM component that can be used to configure and operate  fiscal printers that are popular in Bulgaria. The component supports printing fiscal and non-fiscal receipts, printing daily reports as well as configuring device settings (usually done by registered companies).

UcsFP implements lowest-level protocols that are supported by the fiscal printers, usually sending native commands directly to the COM port the device is attached to.

UcsFP support ESP/POS protocol for "kitchen" order lists and non-fiscal receipts. ESC/POS protocol supports serial and  TCP/IP (LAN) connectivity.

UcsFP supports remoting through COM+ so a single fiscal device can be used by multiple workstations.
